Aim of this series of tutorial is to get you up and running with writing code as quickly as possible.

For this, we will use google colab - you will not need to setup python on your computer - everything will run on google. Assuming that you have a google account, go to you google drive and create a new folder - you can name it whatever you want.

Let's create our first google colab file that we will call:

01_variables_and_basic_operations

It is recommended that you type and execute for yourself all the commands shown in this tutorial, even though you can find the code of each video on GitHub:
